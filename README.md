# advanced-custom-fields-front-end-editor

This is an add-on for WordPress advanced custom fields plugin (https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) by Elliot Condon. 

It allows admins to edit text fields, textareas and wysiwyg fields from front end simillary as you would edit a google doc.

Plugin is in early stages, code needs a bit of cleaning, but it does its job and doesn't collude with other plugins.

Have fun.
